# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where asynchronous operations are not properly handled.  Attempting to access data from a Firestore document snapshot before the data has fully loaded can result in `undefined` or `null` errors.  The solution illustrates how to use promises and asynchronous JavaScript techniques to ensure data is loaded before attempting to access it.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows how attempting to access the `name` property of a document snapshot before the data is loaded throws an error.  This happens because the `onSnapshot` listener is asynchronous, and the code following it might execute before the data is ready.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution by ensuring that the data is loaded before attempting to access its properties.  This can be achieved by using the `.then()` method of the promise returned by `get()` or by using an async/await approach, which is considered best practice for modern asynchronous JavaScript.
